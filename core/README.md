# PackDet Core
Note that `core` corresponds to `maskrcnn_benchmark` in the original maskrcnn_benchmark repository. \
We changed the name to avoid conflicts with the original maskrcnn-benchmark installation.

The core code of PackDet detector is located under [modeling/rpn/packdet](modeling/rpn/packdet).
